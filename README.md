# Project Overview
## Project Name: Quiz App

### Objective:
The goal of the Quiz App is to create an interactive and responsive quiz Page that allows users to test their general knowledge through multiple-choice questions. The app provides an engaging experience with a clean and intuitive user interface, accessible on various devices, including desktops, tablets (like the iPad Pro), and smartphones.

# User stories

### User Story 1: 
* As a user, I want to answer multiple-choice questions,
So that I can test my knowledge on various topics.
### User Story 2: 
* As a user, I want to move to the next question after answering the current one,
So that I can continue the quiz without interruptions.
### User Story 3:
* As a user, I want to use the page on different devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile),
So that I can use the quiz app regardless of the device I’m using.
### User Story 4:
* As a user, I want to see which questions I have answered,
So that I can know how far I’ve progressed in the quiz.
### User Story 4:
* As a user, I want to restart the quiz after completion,
So that I can try again to improve my score.
